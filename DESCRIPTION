Description: Compound deconvolution for chromatographic data, including gas chromatography - mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and comprehensive gas chromatography - mass spectrometry (GCxGC-MS). The package includes functions to perform independent component analysis - orthogonal signal deconvolution (ICA-OSD), independent component regression (ICR), multivariate curve resolution (MCR-ALS) and orthogonal signal deconvolution (OSD) alone.
